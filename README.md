Project Description

This project is a full-stack e-commerce web application built using the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) stack. The MERN stack enables developers to build seamless, JavaScript-powered applications with both frontend and backend functionality.

Milestone 1: Project Overview

Overview of the MERN Stack The MERN stack is a popular technology stack for full-stack web development. It consists of:

MongoDB â€“ NoSQL database for storing application data. Express.js â€“ Backend framework for handling server logic. React.js â€“ Frontend library for building dynamic user interfaces. Node.js â€“ JavaScript runtime for executing server-side code. This stack allows developers to use a single language, JavaScript, throughout the entire application, making development more efficient and beginner-friendly.



### Summary for Milestone 3: Project Setup for Backend ðŸš€

In **Milestone 3**, we advanced our e-commerce application by establishing a solid backend foundation. Here's an overview of what was achieved:

1. **Backend Folder Structure**:
   - Created a well-organized hierarchy for backend files and folders, including directories for routes, controllers, models, and middleware.

2. **Server Setup**:
   - Set up a backend server using **Node.js** and **Express.js**.
   - Configured the server to listen on a designated port.

3. **Database Connection**:
   - Integrated **MongoDB** to enable efficient data storage and management.
   - Verified the connection between the server and the database.

4. **Error Handling**:
   - Implemented basic error-handling mechanisms to provide meaningful feedback and ensure smooth server operation.

5. **Documentation**:
   - Updated the repositoryâ€™s **README file** with a new section titled *Milestone 3: Project Setup for Backend*, summarizing the progress made in this milestone.

Finally, all changes were committed and pushed to the GitHub repository, ensuring the application is ready for further enhancements in the upcoming milestones. ðŸŽ¯
