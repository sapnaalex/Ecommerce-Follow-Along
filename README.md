Project Description

This project is a full-stack e-commerce web application built using the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) stack. The MERN stack enables developers to build seamless, JavaScript-powered applications with both frontend and backend functionality.

Milestone 1: Project Overview

Overview of the MERN Stack The MERN stack is a popular technology stack for full-stack web development. It consists of:

MongoDB – NoSQL database for storing application data. Express.js – Backend framework for handling server logic. React.js – Frontend library for building dynamic user interfaces. Node.js – JavaScript runtime for executing server-side code. This stack allows developers to use a single language, JavaScript, throughout the entire application, making development more efficient and beginner-friendly.
