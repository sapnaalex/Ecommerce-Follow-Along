Project Description

This project is a full-stack e-commerce web application built using the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) stack. The MERN stack enables developers to build seamless, JavaScript-powered applications with both frontend and backend functionality.

Milestone 1: Project Overview

Overview of the MERN Stack The MERN stack is a popular technology stack for full-stack web development. It consists of:

MongoDB â€“ NoSQL database for storing application data. Express.js â€“ Backend framework for handling server logic. React.js â€“ Frontend library for building dynamic user interfaces. Node.js â€“ JavaScript runtime for executing server-side code. This stack allows developers to use a single language, JavaScript, throughout the entire application, making development more efficient and beginner-friendly.


### **Milestone 2: Project Creation and Login Interface Design**

In this milestone, I achieved the set objectives to advance in the development of the E-Commerce Application:

---

#### **1. Project Folder Structure**

- Split the project into a ***frontend*** and a ***backend*** to improve organization and structure. 

#### **2. React Frontend Setup**

- Set up the user interface with a React frontend.

- Set up the required packages for React.

#### **3. Node.js Backend Setup**

- Created a simple Node.js application to initiate the server for the application.

- Set the server up for API integration in the future.

#### **4. Tailwind CSS Integration**

- Set up **Tailwind CSS** to provide utility first responsive styles throughout the application. 

#### **5. Login Page Development**

- Designed the first user interface element, a fully functional **Login Page**.

- Designed the Login Page with Tailwind CSS for a responsive and polished user interface

- Implemented simple features to manage user input.

### **Results**

Everything is in order; the project is organized, and development can continue. 

Login Page. The fully functional styled skeleton of the UI has been done.

The outstanding milestone serves as a foundation for adding more functionality in future 3 phases of the project.





### Summary for Milestone 3: Project Setup for Backend ðŸš€

In **Milestone 3**, we advanced our e-commerce application by establishing a solid backend foundation. Here's an overview of what was achieved:

1. **Backend Folder Structure**:
   - Created a well-organized hierarchy for backend files and folders, including directories for routes, controllers, models, and middleware.

2. **Server Setup**:
   - Set up a backend server using **Node.js** and **Express.js**.
   - Configured the server to listen on a designated port.

3. **Database Connection**:
   - Integrated **MongoDB** to enable efficient data storage and management.
   - Verified the connection between the server and the database.

4. **Error Handling**:
   - Implemented basic error-handling mechanisms to provide meaningful feedback and ensure smooth server operation.

5. **Documentation**:
   - Updated the repositoryâ€™s **README file** with a new section titled *Milestone 3: Project Setup for Backend*, summarizing the progress made in this milestone.

Finally, all changes were committed and pushed to the GitHub repository, ensuring the application is ready for further enhancements in the upcoming milestones. ðŸŽ¯





### **Summary for Milestone 4: User Model, Controllers, and File Uploads ðŸš€**

In Milestone 4, we expanded the backend functionality of our e-commerce application by focusing on user data management and file upload capabilities. Here's an overview of what was achieved:

---

#### **User Model Creation**
- Designed and implemented a **User Model** using MongoDB schemas to define how user data (e.g., name, email, password) is structured and stored in the database.

#### **User Controller Setup**
- Developed a **User Controller** to handle user-related operations such as adding new users and retrieving user information.
- Ensured efficient management of user data through clear and functional controller logic.

#### **File Uploads with Multer**
- Integrated **Multer**, a Node.js middleware, to enable the application to handle file uploads (e.g., user profile pictures).
- Configured Multer to store and manage uploaded files efficiently on the server.

#### **Documentation**
- Updated the repositoryâ€™s README file with a new section titled **Milestone 4: User Model, Controllers, and File Uploads**, summarizing the progress made in this milestone.

Finally, all changes were committed and pushed to the GitHub repository, setting a strong foundation for more advanced features in future milestones. ðŸŽ¯
